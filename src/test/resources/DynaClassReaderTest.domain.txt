# DynaClassReader Test Domain

## Lines starting with '#'
## or '//' are considered comments
## The /* other Java Comment Syntax */ is not supported.
## Nor are comments // at the end of a normal line - only full comment lines 
#
# Encoding is always UTF-8

// Each line is:
//    * either the name of a new class, followed by a '{'
//    * or the name of a new property, followed by a ':'
//        followed by either a Java Class Name necessarily with '.' package delimiter
//        or the name of another DynaClass (without .) in the DynaClassReader
//        which could be defined later in the file, or in another file;
//        and, optionally, a '*' (List) or '<>' (Map) at the end. 
//    * or a '}' to end class
// Newlines matter (contrary to Java), i.e. you cannot put several properties on one line.
